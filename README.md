# PubHunt - Hunt for Puzzles Public keys
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phrutis/LostCoins/main/Others/puzzle.jpg "PubHunt")
</br>forked from [PubHunt](https://github.com/kanhavishva/PubHunt)</br>

## It searches for random compressed Public keys for given hash160.

## The idea to do this
This is only useful for Bitcoin [puzzle transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/08389f34c98c606322740c0be6a7125d9860bb8d5cb182c02f98461e5fa6cd15).</br>
For the [puzzles](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx) **64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71** or **72** and some more... </br>
There are no Public keys are available, so if we can able to find Public keys for those addresses. </br>
Then [Collider](https://github.com/phrutis/Collider) algorithm can be used to solve those puzzles.</br>
That's it, cheers üç∫ 

## How does it work
A public key is randomly generated and compared with the hash160 of the [puzzle](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx) address.</br>
Random Public key -> hex ripemd160 from address

## According to theory 
1 puzzle address(ripemd160) is equal to **79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336** private keys in 256 bit</br> 
**79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336** private keys = **79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336** public keys</br>
**79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336** public keys = **1** puzzle address</br>
Therefore, the chance of finding an address collision is much higher. &#127870; &#x20BF;

## Usage
This is GPU only, no CPU support. 

```
PubHunt.exe -h
PubHunt [-check] [-h] [-v]
        [-gi GPU ids: 0,1...] [-gx gridsize: g0x,g0y,g1x,g1y, ...]
        [-o outputfile] [inputFile]

 -v                       : Print version
 -gi gpuId1,gpuId2,...    : List of GPU(s) to use, default is 0
 -gx g1x,g1y,g2x,g2y, ... : Specify GPU(s) kernel gridsize, default is 8*(MP number),128
 -o outputfile            : Output results to the specified file
 -l                       : List cuda enabled devices
 -check                   : Check CPU and GPU kernel vs CPU
 inputFile                : List of the hash160, one per line in hex format (text mode)
```

- Run: ```PubHunt.exe -gi 0 -gx 9216,1024 puzzle64.txt```
- Run: ```PubHunt.exe -gi 0 -gx 8192,1024 hashes160.txt```

```

## Building
##### Windows
- Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 
- CUDA version [10.22](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exenetwork)
##### Linux
 - Edit the makefile and set up the appropriate CUDA SDK and compiler paths for nvcc. Or pass them as variables to `make` command.

    ```make
    CUDA       = /usr/local/cuda-11.5
    CXXCUDA    = /usr/bin/g++
    ```
 - To build CPU-only version (without CUDA support):
    ```sh
    $ make all
    ```
 - To build with CUDA:
    ```sh
    $ make gpu=1 CCAP=35 all
